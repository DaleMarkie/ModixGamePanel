### 🧑‍💻 Developer Guidelines

- This repository is private; invite-only for core contributors
- All changes must maintain cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox)
- Avoid breaking the backend API contract (Flask routes on `/api/*`)
- Stick to Tailwind conventions and keep UI responsive
- PRs should be tested locally before push
