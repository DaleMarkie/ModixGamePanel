🧩 Modix: Game Panel 

Modix is a completely free, open-source, browser-based control panel built for Project Zomboid (with the ability to extend to other Steam-modded games). You host it yourself and run it locally, giving you full control over your server. It combines modern web technologies with a lightweight backend, delivering smooth, real-time server management without relying on third-party hosting or paid services.

- ✅ Free for personal and educational use
- ✅ Self-hosted — you stay in control of your panel
- ⚡ Real-time logs, mod management, server controls, and more

🧠 Terminal

Modix uses a batch-script system to manage your Project Zomboid server locally. From the panel, you can:

- Start your server directly from the terminal
- Stop the server safely without risking data loss
- Restart the server for updates or configuration changes
- Gracefully shut down to ensure proper saving of all game data

This batch-based approach ensures full compatibility with Steam-modded servers and gives you real-time terminal control without leaving the web panel.

- 🧠 Real-time Logs — Live terminal output via Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- ⚙️ Full Settings Editor — Edit server.ini and SandboxVars.lua directly from the panel
- 🧱 Mod & Workshop Manager — Enable, disable, uninstall, or update Workshop mods with tag-based search and auto-thumbnail detection
- 🌐 Webhook Support — Send and preview custom Discord-style embed messages
- 🧰 File Manager — Browse, upload, and modify files in a clean UI
